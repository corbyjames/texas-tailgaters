# Session Context - Texas Tailgaters Scheduled Sync Implementation
**Date**: October 12, 2025
**Project**: Texas Tailgaters Football Schedule & Score Tracking App

## Session Summary

### Initial Problem
User reported that:
1. Oklahoma game score (Oct 11) wasn't updating - showed "Final" but no score displayed
2. Kentucky game time (Oct 18) hadn't been updated yet
3. Needed scheduled jobs to automatically update game scores and schedule

### Work Completed

#### 1. Score Verification & Corrections
- **Discovered**: Hardcoded backup scores were incorrect across backend and frontend
- **Fixed all 2025 season scores** (verified from ESPN API):
  - Ohio State: 7-14 (L) ✓ Already correct
  - San Jose State: 38-7 (W) - was 59-17 ❌
  - UTEP: 27-10 (W) - was 42-10 ❌
  - Sam Houston: 55-0 on Sep 21 (W) - was 45-6 on Sep 20 ❌
  - Florida: 21-29 (L) - was 28-35 ❌
  - Oklahoma: 23-6 (W) - was 34-3 ❌

#### 2. Configuration Management
- Made all services configurable via environment variables:
  - `TEAM_ID` - ESPN team ID (default: 251 for Texas)
  - `ESPN_BASE_URL` - ESPN API endpoint
  - `ENABLE_SCHEDULER` - Toggle for internal scheduler
  - `SYNC_ON_STARTUP` - Run sync on server start
  - Cron schedule expressions for all jobs
- Updated `.env.example` with complete documentation

#### 3. Schedule Sync Verification
- **Confirmed ESPN API working correctly**:
  - Kentucky game: Oct 18, 2025 at 6:00 PM CT
  - Full 2025 schedule (12 games) fetched successfully
  - Time conversion UTC → Central Time working properly
- **Schedule sync logic verified**:
  - Updates time, TV network, date, ESPN game ID
  - Fuzzy matching for opponent names
  - Adds new games (bowl games) when announced

#### 4. Backend Service Testing
Systematic testing revealed:
- ✅ Health endpoint working
- ✅ Scheduler status API working
- ✅ ESPN API connectivity working
- ✅ Firebase Admin SDK initialized (but operations slow)
- ⚠️ Sync endpoints timeout after 2 minutes (even on pro plan)
- ❌ **Critical Issue**: Internal node-cron scheduler NOT executing jobs

#### 5. Scheduler Migration to Render Cron Jobs
**Problem Identified**: Render services sleep between requests, preventing node-cron from executing

**Solution Implemented**:
- Migrated to Render's external Cron Jobs feature
- Created 3 standalone cron scripts:
  - `backend/cron-schedule-sync.js` - Daily schedule updates
  - `backend/cron-score-sync.js` - Score updates every 30 min
  - `backend/cron-deep-sync.js` - Weekly comprehensive sync
- Updated `render.yaml` with 3 cron job definitions
- Disabled internal scheduler (`ENABLE_SCHEDULER=false`)
- Created comprehensive documentation: `RENDER_CRON_SETUP.md`

### Render Cron Jobs Configuration

```yaml
# Daily Schedule Sync - 6 AM CT (11 AM UTC)
schedule: "0 11 * * *"
script: backend/cron-schedule-sync.js

# Score Sync - Every 30 minutes
schedule: "*/30 * * * *"
script: backend/cron-score-sync.js

# Weekly Deep Sync - Sundays 11 PM CT (Mon 4 AM UTC)
schedule: "0 4 * * 1"
script: backend/cron-deep-sync.js
```

- `backend/cron-deep-sync.js` - Standalone deep sync script
- `RENDER_CRON_SETUP.md` - Complete documentation
- `update-kentucky-time.html` - HTML utility for manual Kentucky game update

**Commits Made**:
1. `7f807b2` - Fix Oklahoma game score to correct 23-6 result
2. `ecedbfe` - Update all 2025 hardcoded scores to match ESPN API
3. `b901419` - Make sync service configurable with environment variables
4. `54391a4` - Update frontend hardcoded scores to match backend
5. `17c68db` - Migrate to Render Cron Jobs for reliable scheduling

### Current State

**Working**:
- ✅ Backend API responding (texas-tailgaters-backend.onrender.com)
- ✅ Frontend deployed (texas-tailgaters.onrender.com)
- ✅ ESPN API integration functional
- ✅ All scores corrected and verified
- ✅ Render Cron Jobs configured (pending deployment)

**Pending**:
- ⏳ Render auto-deployment of new cron jobs
- ⏳ Adding Firebase env vars to cron jobs in Render Dashboard
- ⏳ First scheduled sync run (tomorrow 6 AM CT for schedule sync)
- ⏳ Kentucky game time manual update (until first sync runs)

**Known Issues**:
- Manual sync endpoints timeout (>2 min) - use admin dashboard or wait for cron
- Internal node-cron scheduler doesn't work on Render - migrated to Render Cron Jobs

### Technical Details

**Technology Stack**:
- Frontend: React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Node.js, Express, Firebase Admin SDK
- Database: Firebase Realtime Database
- Scheduling: Render Cron Jobs (formerly node-cron)
- APIs: ESPN CFB API

**Firebase Configuration**:
- Project: texas-tailgaters
- Database URL: https://texas-tailgaters-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com
- Auth: Service account (FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY, etc.)

**ESPN API**:
- Endpoint: https://site.api.espn.com/apis/site/v2/sports/football/college-football
- Team ID: 251 (Texas Longhorns)
- Fetches: Schedule, scores, game details

**Time Zones**:
- App uses: Central Time (America/Chicago)
- Render Cron uses: UTC
- Conversions documented in RENDER_CRON_SETUP.md

### Next Actions Required

1. **In Render Dashboard**:
   - Verify 3 new cron jobs appear after deployment
   - Add Firebase environment variables to each cron job:
     - FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY_ID
     - FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY
     - FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL
     - FIREBASE_CLIENT_ID
     - FIREBASE_CERT_URL

2. **Monitor First Runs**:
   - Daily schedule sync: Tomorrow 6:00 AM CT
   - Score sync: Next :00 or :30 minute mark
   - Check Render Dashboard > Cron Service > Events tab for execution logs

3. **Kentucky Game**:
   - Manually update using `update-kentucky-time.html` utility
   - OR wait until tomorrow's 6 AM sync (will auto-update)

4. **Verify**:
   - Check that cron jobs execute successfully
   - Monitor logs for any errors
   - Verify Kentucky game updates after first sync

### Testing Utilities Created

HTML utilities for debugging/manual updates:
- `update-kentucky-time.html` - Update Kentucky game to Oct 18, 6 PM CT
- `update-oklahoma-2025.html` - Update Oklahoma game score 23-6
- `check-kentucky-firebase.html` - Check Kentucky game data in Firebase

### Important Notes

1. **Test Credentials**:
   - Admin: test@texastailgaters.com / TestPassword123!
   - Member: testmember@texastailgaters.com / TestMember123!

2. **Backup Scores**:
   - Only used when ESPN API fails
   - All verified accurate as of 2025-10-12
   - Include all 6 completed games through Oklahoma

3. **Render Cron Costs**:
   - Free tier: 400 build minutes/month, limited execution
   - Starter: $7/month per cron job ($21 total for 3 jobs)
   - Monitor usage and upgrade if needed

4. **Why Render Cron Instead of node-cron**:
   - Render services sleep when idle
   - node-cron requires service to stay awake
   - Render Cron Jobs are external, guaranteed execution
   - More reliable for scheduled tasks

### Documentation Files

- `RENDER_CRON_SETUP.md` - Complete guide to Render Cron Jobs
- `backend/README.md` - Backend service overview
- `backend/.env.example` - Environment variable documentation
- `SCHEDULED_JOBS_SETUP.md` - Original node-cron setup (now deprecated)

### Key Learnings

1. **Render Platform Limitation**: Free/pro web services sleep, breaking in-process schedulers
2. **ESPN API Reliability**: Consistently provides accurate, real-time data
3. **Time Zone Complexity**: Must convert CT to UTC for Render Cron schedules
4. **Firebase Admin SDK Performance**: Slow operations even on pro plan, consider optimization
5. **Backup Scores Essential**: ESPN API failures require accurate fallback data

### Session End State

All code committed and pushed to GitHub. Render will auto-deploy:
- Updated backend with corrected scores
- Updated frontend with corrected scores
- 3 new Render Cron Jobs (need manual env var setup)

**Ready for production** after Firebase env vars added to cron jobs.
